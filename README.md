# Fur Babies

## About
Fur Babies is an app where users can search for animals by a city and state or zip code. The search results will display a list of pets in the area from local shelters. The user can then add certain pets to their favorites list (still in the making) and update their list throughout the duration of the search for their newest family member.

## Shout Outs

Emmy, Gouda, John, Ivy, Chris (both), Qing, basically everyone. The whole class.

## Future Development
Because the favorites list isn't working yet, I would like to develop that where when a user clicks "add to favorites", the pet from the api will then be stored in the server's database. I would also like to add more styling, especially on my search results display.
